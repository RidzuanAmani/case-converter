# Case Converter
A Python program to convert Camel Case or Pascal Case strings to Snake Case using list comprehension, built for freeCodeCampâ€™s Scientific Computing with Python certification. This project demonstrates concise string manipulation without loops, building on for-loop skills.
## Features
- Converts Pascal/Camel Case (e.g., "IAmAPascalCasedString") to Snake Case ("i_am_a_pascal_cased_string").
- Uses list comprehension for efficient character processing.
## What I Learned
- List comprehension for clean code, replacing for loops like in my Polygon project.
- String methods (lower(), isupper()) from Cipher exercises.
- Join and strip for formatting, inspired by Arithmetic Formatter.
## How to Run
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/RidzuanAmani/case-converter.git`
2. Run the script: `python case_converter.py`
3. Output: `i_am_a_pascal_cased_string`
